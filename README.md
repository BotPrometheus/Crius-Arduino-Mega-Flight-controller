# Crius-Arduino-Mega-Flight-controller

Arduino program for quad-copter and especially for Crius flight controller.

It is incomplete.

Use at your own risk.

Also I have to mention that the main idea comes from mister http://www.brokking.net/ymfc-al_main.html

I made a lot of changes and I will make more. Firstly I want to use sonar for self-landing and takeoff. Secondly a lot of other things. ;)
